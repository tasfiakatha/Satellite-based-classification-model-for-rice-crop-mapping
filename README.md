# Satellite-based-model-for-rice-crop-mapping-and-monitoring-
This project involves the development of a satellite-based model to map and monitor rice crops in An Giang province, Vietnam, using Sentinel-1 radar and Landsat 8-9 imagery.  The model processes these datasets to accurately distinguish between rice and non-rice fields across 600 georeferenced locations.
